    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader should have a foundational understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Additionally, familiarity with the basics of Python is crucial (see microcredit [Python Introduction](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/ifn-public/ki4all/python-introduction)) and Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, along with an introductory knowledge of machine learning principles (as outlined in the microcredit [Machine Learning Introduction](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/ifn-public/ki4all/machine-learning-introduction)). It is essential to understand the composition and significance of training data, alongside fundamental statistical concepts such as classification, features (which correspond to data columns), samples (which correspond to data rows), labels (which form the vector indicating the category of each sample), as well as statistical distributions, including the normal and log-normal distributions. We recommend consulting the following resources:\n",

    "Moreover, an understanding of feature engineering, selection, extraction, and the importance of these processes is crucial for the optimization of machine learning models. Additionally, the application areas of artificial data, and proficiency in managing data formats such as CSV will significantly benefit practitioners in the field of machine learning and data science.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Synthetic biomedical data** is data that is *artificially created* to imitate certain characteristics of real-world medical or biological data, without containing any actual patient information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In medicine and life sciences, datasets can be extremely large and complex. They might include laboratory measurements, genetic sequences, or other measurements taken from living organisms. For instance, **high-dimensional datasets** can arise when thousands of gene expression levels are measured simultaneously for each individual sample, producing vast amounts of information that require specialized methods for analysis and interpretation. Within such data, a **biomarker** is a measurable variable (e.g., a gene expression level or protein concentration) that is associated with a biological condition, disease state, or outcome of interest. Identifying relevant biomarkers is a central task in many biomedical studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why real data is challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with real high-dimensional biological data is challenging for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real patient datasets, it is often unclear which biomarkers are truly important for the question at hand. Some features may appear linked to the outcome purely by chance or due to **confounding factors** — variables that influence both the biomarker and the outcome.\n",
    "- Measurements can have complex and sometimes hidden **dependencies**, where variables are related in subtle ways. These challenges make it hard to tell whether an analysis method is detecting genuine causal signals or merely correlations.\n",
    "- Because the “correct” answers are rarely known in real data, it is difficult to judge how well a method is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why synthetic data helps\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **synthetic biomedical data** becomes valuable. Synthetic data is artificially generated to mimic certain aspects of real biological data, but with a crucial difference: the data creator controls every detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a synthetic dataset, the **feature importance** — meaning how strongly each measurement contributes to predicting the outcome — is predefined.\n",
    "- The internal dependencies between features, as well as the overall distribution of different groups or categories (called **classes**), are also known.\n",
    "- This means researchers can evaluate their methods against a **ground truth**, where the right answer is already established.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic datasets can also be designed with **irrelevant features** — measurements that have nothing to do with the outcome. These irrelevant features might be:\n",
    "- **Purely random** (completely unconnected to anything else in the dataset), or\n",
    "- Belong to a **pseudo-class**, a made-up category that behaves somewhat like a real one but is included purely to challenge the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this could be a random ID number assigned to each sample, which has no biological meaning. Including such features makes it possible to test whether an analysis method can correctly ignore unimportant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that synthetic data can include **random effects**, meaning variations that happen by chance or due to external factors not related to the main research question. For example, measurements might differ slightly depending on which laboratory instrument was used or on what day the test was run. Adding such controlled randomness makes it possible to test how robust a method is to **noise** and other unpredictable factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key design choices when generating synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating synthetic biomedical data involves deciding in advance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What variables (features) to include** – for example, simulated gene expression values, protein concentrations, or blood test results.\n",
    "- **How those features are related** – such as correlations between certain biomarkers or patterns within specific patient groups.\n",
    "- **How many categories (classes) exist** – for instance, “healthy” vs. “diseased” groups.\n",
    "- **How much randomness to add** – to reflect biological variation or measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because synthetic biomedical data is fully artificial, it has no privacy concerns — no real patient information is included. It cannot be linked back to individuals, contains no sensitive attributes, and requires no patient consent. This freedom from legal and ethical restrictions allows the data to be shared across borders, published openly in repositories, used in teaching and training, and incorporated into collaborative projects without the need for data use agreements or ethics approval.\n",

    "## Applications of synthetic biomedical data\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic datasets support a wide range of use cases in research, teaching, and development, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method development**: Creating controlled datasets to test new feature selection or classification algorithms.\n",
    "- **Benchmarking**: Comparing multiple methods on identical, reproducible data. Test feature selection, classification, and other ML methods.\n",
    "- **Scenario testing** Assessing models under different hypothetical conditions.\n",
    "- **Prototyping and software testing** Develop pipelines before deploying on sensitive data.\n",
    "- **Pipeline testing**: Checking preprocessing steps (normalization, imputation, batch correction) against known expected results.\n",
    "- **Model validation** Validate models on synthetic data before applying them to real-world scenarios.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis testing** Test hypotheses in a controlled environment without real-world constraints.\n",
    "- **Simulating edge cases**: Generating data for rare diseases or extreme conditions to test model performance.\n",
    "- **Observe random effects**: Including sources of variation unrelated to the main research question to test model robustness.\n",
    "- **Educational demonstrations**: Teaching statistical and ML concepts without needing access to real patient data.\n",
    "- **Privacy-preserving research** Share and analyze data without violating privacy laws.\n",

    "- Artificial (synthetic) data is computer-generated and designed to mimic the structure and statistics of real data, but it is only a model and cannot capture every detail.\n",
