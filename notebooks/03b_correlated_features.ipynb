    "# Lesson 3c: Correlated Features (Biological Pathways)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "Previously, you learned that not all features are informative.\n",
    "Spurious correlations between noise features and the label can arise by chance, especially as dimensionality increases.\n",
    "Now we explore what happens when features are redundant because they move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this lesson: Correlated features?\n",
    "In real biomedical data, features are often not independent. Biological processes often involve groups of molecules that move together. Biological examples include:\n",
    "- Genes in the same pathway may be co-expressed (e.g., Gene A and Gene B always expressed together).\n",
    "- Proteins in a signaling cascade may be activated together.\n",
    "- Metabolites in the same biochemical pathway are chemically linked, and their concentrations co-vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dependencies create correlated features in real datasets. Strong correlations can:\n",
    "- Reduce the unique information each feature provides\n",
    "- Create instability in model training and feature importance\n",
    "- Mislead or complicate model training and feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data allows us to add and control correlations. By simulating them in synthetic data, we can study their impact on visualization, classification, and feature selection under known ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terms\n",
    "- **Feature correlation**: statistical association between features (e.g., Pearson correlation).\n",
    "- **Cluster / module**: a group of features that co-vary.\n",
    "- **Co-variation**: features that change together across samples.\n",
    "- **Equicorrelation**: all features in a cluster have nearly the same pairwise correlation.\n",
    "- **AR(1) / Toeplitz**: correlation decays with distance in feature index.\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: multiple features carry nearly the same information.\n",
    "- **Anchor** (driver): the feature that primarily carries the class signal in a cluster.\n",
    "- **Proxies**: followers that correlate with the anchor and partially mirror its information.\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: strong feature correlations that make individual coefficients unstable (especially in linear models).\n",
    "- **Attribution ambiguity (non-identifiability of individual effects)**: when several correlated features predict equally well, importance can be spread or exchanged among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll learn\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Generate pathway-like clusters of features with a tunable correlation (e.g., equicorrelated or AR(1)/Toeplitz structure).\n",
    "- Compose a dataset by mixing correlated blocks with independent features to reach a target dimensionality p.\n",
    "- Introduce a modest class-conditional shift so that only a subset of cluster members carries signal.\n",
    "- Visualize and interpret the empirical correlation matrix.\n",
    "- Evaluate how correlation affects model performance and selection stability.\n",
    "- Explain practical implications (redundancy, multicollinearity, non-identifiability of individual effects, proxy features) and recommend mitigation strategies (grouped selection, stability checks)."

    "# Lesson 3b — Correlated Features (Biological Pathways)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "In 3a you saw that **not all features are informative**.\n",
    "Here we study a different challenge: features that are **redundant** because they move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this lesson? (Biological rationale)\n",
    "In real biomedical data, features are rarely independent. Biological processes act in **modules**:\n",
    "- **Co-expressed genes** in one pathway,\n",
    "- **Proteins** in the same signaling cascade,\n",
    "- **Metabolites** within a biochemical route.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dependencies yield **correlated features**. Correlation can:\n",
    "- Reduce the *unique* information per feature,\n",
    "- Create **instability** in model training and feature importance,\n",
    "- Mislead selection procedures (e.g., picking many proxies of the same driver).\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data lets us **inject and control** correlation to study its effects on\n",
    "visualization, classification, and feature selection under known ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "After this notebook you will be able to:\n",
    "- **Simulate** correlated feature clusters that mimic pathway-like structure.\n",
    "- **Visualize** correlation with a heatmap (e.g., `sns.heatmap`) or pair plot (`sns.pairplot`).\n",
    "- **Reason** about how correlation affects model performance and feature selection stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you’ll do in this notebook\n",
    "1. **Generate pathway-like clusters** of features with a tunable correlation (e.g., equicorrelated or AR(1)/Toeplitz structure).\n",
    "2. **Combine** correlated blocks with independent noise/features to reach a chosen dimensionality.\n",
    "3. **(Optional)** Add a modest class-conditional shift so that some (but not all) features in a cluster carry signal.\n",
    "4. **Visualize** the empirical correlation matrix with a heatmap; inspect small clusters via pair plots.\n",
    "5. **Reflect** on implications for linear models, tree ensembles, and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key terms (at a glance)\n",
    "- **Cluster / module**: a group of features that co-vary.\n",
    "- **Anchor** (driver): the feature that primarily carries the class signal in a cluster.\n",
    "- **Proxies**: followers that correlate with the anchor and partially mirror its information.\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: high linear dependence among predictors; can inflate variance of estimates.\n",
    "- **Equicorrelation**: all features in a cluster have the same pairwise correlation.\n",
    "- **AR(1) / Toeplitz**: correlation decays with distance in feature index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical pitfalls you’ll observe\n",
    "- **Redundant picks**: selectors choose many proxies of one anchor → low diversity.\n",
    "- **Unstable rankings**: correlated features swap order across resamples/CV folds.\n",
    "- **Masked effects**: in linear models, coefficients shrink or flip under strong collinearity.\n",
    "- **Overconfident metrics**: naive CV may look good even when the model relies on one cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick takeaways\n",
    "- Correlated blocks are **biologically realistic** and **statistically tricky**.\n",
    "- Good evaluations use **group-aware** reasoning (e.g., prefer diverse features across clusters).\n",
    "- Visual checks (heatmaps/pair plots) help detect **modules** before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** Generate a small dataset with 2–3 correlated clusters, plot the correlation heatmap, and compare how a linear model vs. a tree ensemble behaves on these features.\n"

    "In real biomedical data, however, many biomarkers are **not independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why this matters:**\n",
    "> - Biological processes often involve groups of molecules that move together.\n",
    "> - Strong correlations can reduce the *unique* information each feature provides.\n",
    "> - Correlated features can mislead or complicate model training and feature selection.\n",
    "> - Synthetic data allows us to add and control correlations deliberately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological examples\n",
    "- **Genes in the same pathway** may be co-expressed (e.g., Gene A and Gene B always expressed together).\n",
    "- **Proteins in a signaling cascade** may be activated together.\n",
    "- **Metabolites in the same biochemical pathway** are chemically linked, and their concentrations co-vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dependencies create **correlated features** in real datasets.\n",
    "By simulating them in synthetic data, we can study their impact on visualization, classification, and feature selection.\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "Simulate correlated features and visualize their relationships with a correlation matrix.\n",
