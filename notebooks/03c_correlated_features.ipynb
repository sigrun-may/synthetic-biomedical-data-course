    "# Lesson 3c: Correlated Features (Biological Pathways)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "Previously, you learned that not all features are informative.\n",
    "Spurious correlations between noise features and the label can arise by chance, especially as dimensionality increases.\n",
    "Now we explore what happens when features are redundant because they move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this lesson: Correlated features?\n",
    "In real biomedical data, features are often not independent. Biological processes often involve groups of molecules that move together. Biological examples include:\n",
    "- Genes in the same pathway may be co-expressed (e.g., Gene A and Gene B always expressed together).\n",
    "- Proteins in a signaling cascade may be activated together.\n",
    "- Metabolites in the same biochemical pathway are chemically linked, and their concentrations co-vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dependencies create correlated features in real datasets. Strong correlations can:\n",
    "- Reduce the unique information each feature provides\n",
    "- Create instability in model training and feature importance\n",
    "- Mislead or complicate model training and feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data allows us to add and control correlations. By simulating them in synthetic data, we can study their impact on visualization, classification, and feature selection under known ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terms\n",
    "- **Feature correlation**: statistical association between features (e.g., Pearson correlation).\n",
    "- **Cluster / module**: a group of features that co-vary.\n",
    "- **Co-variation**: features that change together across samples.\n",
    "- **Equicorrelation**: all features in a cluster have nearly the same pairwise correlation.\n",
    "- **AR(1) / Toeplitz**: correlation decays with distance in feature index.\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: multiple features carry nearly the same information.\n",
    "- **Anchor** (driver): the feature that primarily carries the class signal in a cluster.\n",
    "- **Proxies**: followers that correlate with the anchor and partially mirror its information.\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: strong feature correlations that make individual coefficients unstable (especially in linear models).\n",
    "- **Attribution ambiguity (non-identifiability of individual effects)**: when several correlated features predict equally well, importance can be spread or exchanged among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll learn\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Generate pathway-like clusters of features with a tunable correlation (e.g., equicorrelated or AR(1)/Toeplitz structure).\n",
    "- Compose a dataset by mixing correlated blocks with independent features to reach a target dimensionality p.\n",
    "- Visualize and interpret the empirical correlation matrix.\n",
    "- Explain practical implications (redundancy, multicollinearity, non-identifiability of individual effects, proxy features) and recommend mitigation strategies (grouped selection, stability checks)."

    "\n",
    "The heatmap visualizes the **empirical pairwise correlations** between all features across two simulated clusters:\n",
    "- **Cluster 1 (left block)** follows an *equicorrelated* structure — every pair of features shares approximately the same correlation. This produces a uniform bright block, reflecting a single shared latent factor that drives all features equally.\n",
    "- **Cluster 2 (right block)** follows a *Toeplitz (AR-1)* structure — correlations decay gradually with feature distance from the anchor. This creates a banded pattern where nearby features are strongly correlated, and distant ones less so.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "- Within each cluster, features move together to varying degrees, mimicking biological pathways or co-regulated gene modules.\n",
    "- The near-zero correlations between clusters confirm that they are **independent by design**.\n",
    "- Diagonal values are 1 by definition (self-correlation).\n",
    "- Small deviations from the idealized pattern arise from **finite-sample variability**.\n",

    "Controlled correlation structures allow us to systematically study how **redundancy**, **multicollinearity**, and **proxy features** influence model performance and feature selection stability in high-dimensional biomedical data."

    "# Typical pitfalls you'll observe with correlated features\n",
    "Correlated features introduce several challenges in machine learning pipelines, especially in biomedical contexts where pathways and co-regulated modules are common. Here are some typical pitfalls:\n",
    "### Feature selection issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redundant picks: Selectors choose many proxies from one anchor cluster → low diversity, inflated feature counts\n",
    "* Unstable rankings: Correlated features swap positions across resamples/CV folds → unreliable interpretation\n",
    "* Split votes: Selection algorithms \"distribute\" importance across cluster members instead of identifying the anchor\n",
    "* Masked coefficients: In linear models, coefficients shrink or flip sign under strong collinearity → misleading effect sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model evaluation traps:\n",
    "* Leakage via feature selection: Selecting features on full data before CV → overly optimistic performance estimates\n",
    "* Group structure ignored: Random CV splits batches/sites between train and test → artificially high scores when batch effects exist\n",
    "* Metric blindness: Accuracy looks great even when model relies entirely on one correlated cluster (or noise with lucky correlation)\n",
    "* Overfitting to correlation structure: Model memorizes which features \"travel together\" rather than learning true class signal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation failures:\n",
    "**Correlation-specific issues:**\n",
    "* Instability across folds: Different CV folds select different correlated features\n",
    "  → model composition changes unpredictably\n",
    "\n",
    "**General p≫n issues (worsened by correlation):**\n",
    "* Feature selection leakage: Standard k-fold CV combined with feature selection\n",
    "  on full data → information leaks from test into training\n",
    "* Nested CV is necessary but often skipped → hyperparameter tuning leaks information\n",
    "* Small sample size (n=50–100) + many features (p=500) → high variance in CV\n",
    "  estimates, single splits misleading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why generate correlated features for benchmarking?\n",
    "Correlated features stress-test the entire ML pipeline in ways uncorrelated synthetic data cannot:\n",
    "### 1. Expose feature selection fragility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Methods like Lasso, mRMR, or univariate filters must decide which cluster member to pick\n",
    "* Different seeds/resamples → different choices → unstable gene/biomarker lists\n",
    "* Ground truth benefit: You know features 0–9 are informative; if the selector picks features 11, 23, 45 (all correlated noise), you can prove it failed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Test model robustness to multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear models: do regularization methods (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) correctly handle redundancy?\n",
    "* Tree-based models: are they truly \"immune\" to correlation, or do they still split votes across cluster members?\n",
    "* Controlled comparison: Generate identical class separation with r=0.0, 0.5, 0.9 → observe degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reveal metric blind spots\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model using only one noisy cluster member can achieve AUC=0.85 if that member happens to correlate with the outcome\n",
    "* Permutation baselines become critical: shuffle class labels → does performance drop? If not, model found spurious structure\n",
    "* Correlation amplifies the risk of \"good metrics, bad model\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Force proper cross-validation discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "* With correlated features, naive CV (select features → split → train) always leaks information\n",
    "* Nested CV is the only valid approach, but it's computationally expensive and often skipped in practice\n",
    "* Synthetic benchmark: Train students/researchers to detect and avoid this mistake with data where you can quantify the bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Simulate biological pathway structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real biomedical data has correlated features (gene co-expression, metabolic pathways, protein complexes)\n",
    "* Uncorrelated synthetic data is too clean → models perform unrealistically well, then fail on real data\n",
    "* Realism test: If a method can't handle r=0.7–0.9 in synthetic data, it won't handle real biological pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Enable stability analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run 100 bootstrap resamples → measure Jaccard stability, Kuncheva index\n",
    "* Expected outcome: Correlated features → low stability (≈0.3–0.5), uncorrelated → high stability (≈0.8)\n",
    "* Provides quantitative benchmark: \"This feature selection method is unstable under correlation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick takeaway\n",
    "### Correlated features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Biologically realistic (genes/proteins don't act independently)\n",
    "* Statistically challenging (violate standard assumptions)\n",
    "* Pedagogically valuable (make invisible pitfalls visible through controlled experiments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without correlation in synthetic data, learners miss the most common real-world failure modes. Generating Toeplitz/AR(1) clusters is relevant to explore how correlation strength (ρ) and cluster size affect model behavior and feature selection stability."
