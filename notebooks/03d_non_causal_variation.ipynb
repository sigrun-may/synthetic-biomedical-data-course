    "## Simulating Batch Effects (Non-Causal Variation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "In real biomedical datasets, variation often arises not only from biology but also from *technical* or *organizational* factors — such as sequencing batches, scanner type, or measurement site.\n",
    "These **batch effects** can mimic true biological signal and mislead models if not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What a batch effect is — statistically\n",
    "\n",
    "A batch effect is just a **group-specific shift** or **scaling difference** in the features.\n",
    "Formally, if (X) are your features and (b) denotes the batch label:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "X_{i, \\text{batch}=b} = X_i + \\Delta_b + \\varepsilon_i\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each batch (b) has its own offset (\\Delta_b), but the underlying biology is unchanged.\n",
    "The generator already supports this mechanism through *group-wise mean shifts* or *pseudo-classes* — no new function is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantics vs. mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **mechanics** (mean shift, scaling, correlation) are identical to class-conditional shifts used for informative features.\n",
    "* The **semantics** differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For informative features, the shift reflects a *biological effect* (e.g., disease vs. control).\n",
    "  * For batch effects, the shift reflects a *non-biological factor* (e.g., site, device, technician).\n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning the shift to a variable like `meta.batch_id` instead of the class label, we reinterpret the same statistical operation as a *non-causal source of variation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it matters for model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "If batches are unevenly distributed across classes (e.g., all class 0 samples from site A, all class 1 from site B),\n",
    "a model can achieve high accuracy by learning **batch identity** rather than biology.\n",
    "Under **RandomKFold**, such leakage remains hidden;\n",
    "under **GroupKFold** or **LeaveOneGroupOut**, performance collapses — revealing the confounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "> Batch effects are not a new data-generation feature but a new **interpretation** of an existing one.\n",
    "> The generator stays the same — what changes is **how you label and analyze** the resulting structure."

    "## Confounding: when subgroup structure mimics the target\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "A confounder is a variable that influences both the features and the target label, creating a spurious association.\n",
    "In your synthetic setup, this happens when a non-biological factor (e.g., batch, site, or instrument) is correlated with class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you simulate two hospitals (A and B) as batches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All samples from hospital A happen to belong to class 0,\n",
    "* All samples from hospital B belong to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you include batch-specific shifts (e.g., slightly higher mean expression or intensity values per hospital), the model can perfectly separate the classes without learning the biological signal at all — it only needs to detect which hospital a sample came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the model’s apparent accuracy is high under Random Cross-Validation, because samples from the same hospital appear in both train and test folds. But under GroupKFold (splitting by hospital), performance collapses — revealing that the model learned batch identity rather than biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Create confounding where models learn subgroup membership instead of biology” means you deliberately align the subgroup variable (batch/pseudo-class) with the target, so that the model’s success reflects spurious correlation rather than causal signal."

    "## Pseudo-classes (Artificial Subgroups)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a pseudo-class?**\n",
    "A *pseudo-class* is a categorical subgroup present in the data that **creates visible clusters or patterns** but is **not causally related to the target outcome**. Models can latch onto these subgroups as “shortcuts,” leading to **spurious performance** and poor generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why this matters**\n",
    "> - Pseudo-classes can **mislead models** (shortcut learning) and inflate metrics.\n",
    "> - If train/test splits are not subgroup-aware, you risk **data leakage** (e.g., model learns “site” instead of biology).\n",
    "> - Handling pseudo-classes properly improves **robustness** and **reproducibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of pseudo-classes\n",
    "- **Eye color (when predicting heart disease)** — while “eye color” by itself is an **irrelevant feature**, if we *use it to divide the dataset into subgroups*\n",
    "  (e.g., “blue-eyed patients” vs. “green-eyed patients”), it becomes a **pseudo-class**.\n",
    "  The subgroups exist, but they do not causally explain heart disease.\n",
    "- **Gender/sex**, **age-band**, **ethnicity** *can* behave like pseudo-classes **if domain knowledge says they are unrelated to the outcome you study**.\n",
    "    - Example: If you simulate a disease independent of sex, then **sex** can be a pseudo-class.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ In many real settings these variables **do influence** biology; treat as **sensitive attributes** and consider fairness implications.\n",
    "- **Hospital / site ID** — same disease biology, but different centers.\n",
    "- **Batch or instrument ID** — processing differences unrelated to outcome.\n",
    "- **Recruitment year or technician** — administrative grouping, not biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How pseudo-classes mislead models\n",
    "- They introduce **structure orthogonal to the target** (e.g., site-specific shifts), which the model might exploit.\n",
    "- If train/test splits don’t block by subgroup, metrics can be **over-optimistic**.\n",
    "- Correlated pseudo-classes (e.g., site correlates with outcome due to sampling bias) act as **confounders**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we do in synthetic data\n",
    "We deliberately introduce pseudo-classes to **stress-test** pipelines:\n",
    "1. **Independent pseudo-class**: subgroup affects features (e.g., mean shift) but **not** the label.\n",
    "2. **Partially confounded pseudo-class**: subgroup correlates with the label (sampling bias) to demonstrate spurious gains.\n",
    "3. **Strongly confounded pseudo-class**: extreme case to show failure when CV is not subgroup-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Add an artificial categorical variable and explore how it might mislead models or inflate performance when not handled correctly."
