    "# Lesson 4a: Understanding Non-Causal Variation and Confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "In previous lessons, you learned to generate synthetic biomedical datasets with:\n",
    "- Informative features that carry true class signals\n",
    "- Noise features that are irrelevant\n",
    "- Correlated feature clusters mimicking biological pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements reflect **causal biology**: features that directly relate to the disease or outcome of interest. However, real-world biomedical data contains an additional layer of complexity that has nothing to do with biology: **non-causal variation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this lesson matters: The hidden danger in biomedical data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a study where:\n",
    "- Site A recruited mostly healthy controls\n",
    "- Site B recruited mostly diseased patients\n",
    "- Both sites used different measurement instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model achieves 95% accuracy! But is it learning biology or just detecting which site the sample came from? This is **confounding** – when a non-causal factor (site) is inadvertently associated with the outcome (disease status).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-causal variation is one of the most common reasons why:\n",
    "- Models fail to generalize to new sites or cohorts\n",
    "- Biomarker discoveries don't replicate in independent studies\n",
    "- Published ML models never make it to clinical practice\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson teaches you to recognize, understand, and eventually simulate these artifacts so you can:\n",
    "- Design robust evaluation strategies\n",
    "- Test whether your method learns real biology or memorizes artifacts\n",
    "- Develop models that generalize beyond the training cohort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terms\n",
    "- **Non-causal variation / artifacts**: systematic differences in data that are unrelated to the biological outcome of interest.\n",
    "- **Batch effects**: technical variation from sample processing (e.g., different lab personnel, reagent lots, measurement dates).\n",
    "- **Site effects**: systematic differences between data collection sites (e.g., hospitals, research centers).\n",
    "- **Instrument effects**: variation from different measurement devices or protocols.\n",
    "- **Recruitment artifacts**: imbalances in how patients were selected or enrolled (e.g., time periods, eligibility criteria).\n",
    "- **Pseudo-class / spurious subgroup**: a group that looks like a biological class but is actually driven by non-causal factors.\n",
    "- **Confounding**: when a non-causal factor correlates with (or even perfectly predicts) the outcome, creating a spurious association.\n",
    "- **Perfect confounding**: when site/batch membership completely determines class label (e.g., all controls from Site A, all cases from Site B).\n",
    "- **Partial confounding**: when site/batch membership is strongly but not perfectly associated with class.\n",
    "- **Leakage (in this context)**: when a model learns to predict non-causal subgroup membership instead of the true biological outcome.\n",
    "- **Distributional shift**: when test data comes from a different distribution than training data (e.g., new site, new instrument).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll learn\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Distinguish between causal biological variation and non-causal artifacts.\n",
    "- Identify common sources of non-causal variation in biomedical studies.\n",
    "- Explain what confounding means and why it's dangerous for machine learning.\n",
    "- Recognize the difference between perfect and partial confounding.\n",
    "- Understand why standard random cross-validation fails under confounding.\n",
    "- Articulate the consequences of models that learn artifacts instead of biology.\n",
    "- Appreciate why synthetic data with controlled confounding is essential for method testing."

    "\n",

    "- **Multi-site studies**: Different hospitals or research centers contribute samples\n",
    "- **Multi-batch processing**: Samples are processed in groups over time\n",
    "- **Equipment upgrades**: Measurement technology changes during a study\n",
    "- **Protocol variations**: Slight differences in sample handling or preparation\n",
    "- **Time-dependent factors**: Seasonal effects, personnel changes, reagent lot variations\n",

    "## Causal vs. Non-Causal Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the distinction, consider a cancer classification problem:\n",

    "Site B recruited: 20% healthy, 80% cancer\n",

    "- Site membership **correlates with** disease status by chance (or flawed study design)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Technical variation introduced by sample processing in groups (batches).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical scenarios:\n",
    "- **Microarray/RNA-seq**: Samples processed on different days or by different personnel\n",
    "- **Mass spectrometry**: Instrument calibration drifts between runs\n",
    "- **Flow cytometry**: Reagent lot changes, temperature variations\n",
    "- **Clinical chemistry**: Different analyzer calibrations\n",

    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- Affects **all features** in a batch simultaneously (though with varying strength)\n",
    "- Can be **additive** (constant shift) or **multiplicative** (scaling)\n",
    "- May have **non-linear effects** (batch × feature interactions)\n",
    "- Often **partially confounded** with outcome if batches processed samples based on availability\n",

    "```\n",
    "Batch 1 (January):  Controls processed first (40 samples)\n",
    "Batch 2 (February): Mixed (20 controls, 20 cases)\n",
    "Batch 3 (March):    Cases processed last (40 samples)\n",

    "→ Model might learn: \"High expression in batch 3 = cancer\"\n",

    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- Can include **all batch effect types** (technical + operational)\n",
    "- May include **population differences** (demographics, genetics)\n",
    "- Often have **strong confounding** if sites specialize (e.g., cancer center vs. general hospital)\n",
    "- Hardest to correct because sites differ in **multiple unmeasured ways**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Site A (University Hospital):    Recruited severe cases\n",
    "Site B (Community Clinic):       Recruited mild cases + controls\n",
    "Site C (Preventive Care Center): Recruited only healthy controls\n",

    "## 2.3 Instrument and Protocol Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Variation from different measurement technologies or procedures.\n",

    "### Typical scenarios:\n",
    "- **Technology upgrades**: Study switches from microarray to RNA-seq mid-way\n",
    "- **Vendor differences**: Roche vs. Abbott vs. Siemens diagnostic assays\n",
    "- **Protocol versions**: Sample prep updated based on manufacturer recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- Creates **discrete subgroups** in feature space\n",
    "- May affect **specific feature subsets** (e.g., only low-abundance proteins)\n",
    "- Confounding occurs if instrument change **coincides with** changes in patient recruitment\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Variation that correlates with time (recruitment year, processing date).\n",

    "### Typical scenarios:\n",
    "- **Seasonal effects**: Vitamin D levels vary by season\n",
    "- **Enrollment period**: Early vs. late recruitment in longitudinal study\n",
    "- **Secular trends**: Disease definition changes (e.g., diagnostic criteria updates)\n",
    "- **Storage duration**: Sample degradation over years\n",

    "### Why it's dangerous:\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "- Exposes whether selected features generalize across batches\n",
